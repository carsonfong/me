Effective communication is more than just ensuring your audience understands your idea. It also includes providing them the ability to share the idea with other people.

By gifting your idea in a tidy story, you give your audience a vessel they can use to it pass on. A good story is like a good Tupperware container: compact, portable, and easy to use.

Itâ€™s an obvious concept in the context of myths and fables, but often misunderstood at work. So much of organizational communication involves passing along information and ideas. Oftentimes, the person who needs to hear our idea is not in the same room as us.

Selling our ideas to people we can reach is not enough. We have to give them the right Pyrex containers to pack up our ideas and bring them to their next conversation.
